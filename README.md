Challenge 2- Sorting Data

I actually surprised myself and finished this assignment which I am really happy about. The only thing that I would change is the overall look of the webiste but the way that html has it's table element there's really not much I can do. A lot of trial and error was done especially with the reverse button at the end when I had everything else done but other then that it was pretty smooth sailing.
